#we are going to lok into tuples
#tuples are ordered , unchangeable and allow duplicate Items
#the indexing is similar to that of arrays and lists starting from 0 
#The data types in tupls can be string intergers or even boolean
#A tuple can even contain different data types just like lists 
#The type for tuples is 'tuple'

fruits = ( "apple", "mango" , "banana" , "watermelon " ,"kiwi" ,"orange" , "lemon")
print(fruits)
print(fruits[1])   #accessing the second element in tuple using index

#The length of the tuple
print(len(fruits))

#one item tuple
name = ("verstappen",)
print(type(name))
