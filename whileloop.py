#we are going to look into some while,loop items
#ctrl+alt+n can be used to easily run the code
#The primitive command are going to be similar to those of other programming languages ....those are while and for

#A simple example is as follows
i = 1

while i  < 6 : 
    print(i)
    if i == 3 : 
        break
    i+= 1 
#Remember to increment the loop or else the loo^p is going to continue forever
    #increment is by += and not the normal ++

#The break statement can be use dto stop the loop even though the statement is true


#continue allows skips the Iteration that meets the give criteria and continues to the other iterations untill the end of the loop

#you can even add else there to allow you to run a block of cod eonce the condition is not true
